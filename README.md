A Python package for splitting, creating, and validating ligand files

### Usage

This repository was initially made to enhance a series of notebooks that explore molecular docking using Jupyter notebooks. This repository, called basil_dock, is currently being developed and will be released in the near future. Work is being done to allow for the execution of ligandsplitter code as a stand-alone program.
